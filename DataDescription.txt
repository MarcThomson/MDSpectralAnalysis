Datasets contained here were computed using LAMMPS example scripts for methanol and sodium chloride.

Vel_data_NaCl.mat contains the x,y,z velocities for all atoms in the sodium chloride system as a function of time. Time is in fs, and velocity is in Angstroms/picosecond.

Vel_data_MetOH.mat contains the x,y,z velocities for all atoms in the methanol system as a function of time. Time is in fs, and velocity is in  Angstroms/femtosecond.

Vacf_total_NaCl.mat contains the computed velocity autocorrelation function for the sodium chloride system. Time is in fs.

Vacf_total_MetOH.mat contains the computed velocity autocorrelation function for the methanol system. Time is in fs.
